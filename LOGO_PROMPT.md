# Logo Creation Prompt

**Create a modern, minimalist app icon for "Daily To-Do List" — an iOS productivity app positioned as a simpler, more focused alternative to Apple's Reminders app.**

## Concept Direction

Design an icon that communicates **daily rhythm**, **recurring tasks**, and **focused simplicity**. The app's core philosophy is "do less, better" — helping users focus on today's tasks with smart recurring task management that resets each day.

## Visual Elements to Consider

- **Checkmark or completion symbol** — represents task accomplishment
- **Circular/cyclical motif** — suggests daily recurrence and rhythm (tasks that come back each day)
- **Calendar or "day" reference** — subtle nod to the daily focus (not weekly/monthly complexity)
- **Clean, single-purpose design** — conveys simplicity vs. Reminders' feature bloat

## Style Guidelines

- **Minimalist and modern** — iOS-native feel, not skeuomorphic
- **Primary colors**: Fresh green (success/completion) with optional blue accent (recurring indicator)
- **Shape**: Rounded square (iOS app icon standard) or can be designed to work within one
- **Avoid**: Cluttered designs, multiple small elements, busy patterns
- **Feel**: Calm, focused, daily ritual, lightweight productivity

## Brand Personality

- **Simple** — one glance tells you what it does
- **Fresh** — feels lighter and more approachable than Reminders
- **Reliable** — your daily companion, tasks that "just work"
- **Modern** — clean lines, contemporary iOS aesthetic

## Marketing Angle

This app is positioned as **a better Reminders app from a different angle**:
- Less complexity, more focus
- Daily-first approach vs. overwhelming lists
- Recurring tasks that automatically reset each day
- Streamlined for what matters today

## Tagline Context (for inspiration)

- *"Your daily tasks. Simplified."*
- *"Focus on today. Repeat tomorrow."*
- *"The Reminders app you actually want to use."*

## Technical Requirements

- Works at small sizes (app icon on home screen)
- Readable silhouette
- Looks good on both light and dark backgrounds
- High contrast for accessibility
- Scalable from 16x16 to 1024x1024

## Mood References

Think of the simplicity of apps like Things 3, Todoist, or Clear — icons that communicate purpose instantly without visual noise. The goal is to feel like a breath of fresh air compared to Apple's increasingly complex Reminders app.
